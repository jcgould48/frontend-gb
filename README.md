## Welcome to Git Buzzed!
### Have a cold one

 In 2020 we all realized the importance the internet has in our lives especially when we are only able to meet digitally.  Git Buzzed was created to provide a space for friends to meet up with the assistance of a preferred video chat service and play some fun and interactive games.

 Currently Tic Tac Toe and Minesweeper are available to play.  We hope to add a larger selection of games in the future and allow players to compete over the internet.

 And to keep things interesting we added a drinking component for each game.


 ## Game Instructions- 

## Tic Tac Chug -
Play this game like normal tic tac toe. The loser has to take a drink.  For draws, both players have to take a drink.


## BeerSweeper- 
The game play is nearly identical to the classic mine sweeper game. Players alternate in revealing squares.  Who ever hits a mine, or a beer glass in this case has to drink. If one player completers the puzzle, the other player has to take two drinks.

## App Instructions-
If players want to download this app on their own computers, one person must download both front and back end repositories.

[Link to the Frontend](https://github.com/jcgould48/frontend-gb)


1. Fork and clone both repositories
2. npm install in directory
3. Create .env on the backend file and populate it with the following.

    * SECRET = 'Any string of text'
    * REFRESH_SECRET = 'Any string of text'
     * MONGODB_URI = 'Path to your MongoDB storage'

4. On the frontend create .env.development , .env.production files and populate them with the following.

* REACT_APP_API_HOST_ADDRESS=http://localhost:3001
